description: PAW32xx ultra low power wireless mouse chip

compatible: "pixart,paw3222"

include: spi-device.yaml

properties:
  irq-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
    description: GPIO connected to the motion pin, active low.

  power-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: false
    description: GPIO connected to the power control pin.

  snipe-layers:
    type: array
    required: false
    description: |
      List of layer numbers to switch between using the snipes-layers feature.

  scroll-layers:
    type: array
    required: false
    description: |
      List of layer numbers to switch between using the scroll-layers feature.

  scroll-horizontal-layers:
    type: array
    required: false
    description: |
      List of layer numbers to switch between using the horizontal scroll feature.

  res-cpi:
    type: int
    description: |
      CPI resolution for the sensor. This can also be changed in runtime using
      the paw32xx_set_resolution() API.

  force-awake:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Initialize the sensor in "force awake" mode. This can also be enabled or
      disabled in runtime by the application using the paw32xx_force_awake()
      API.

  rotation:
    type: int
    required: false
    description: |
      Physical rotation of the sensor in degrees. (0, 90, 180, 270)
      If not specified, defaults to the value of CONFIG_PAW32XX_SENSOR_ROTATION.

  scroll-tick:
    type: int
    required: false
    description: |
      Threshold for scroll movement (delta value above which scroll is triggered).
      If not specified, defaults to the value of CONFIG_PAW32XX_SCROLL_TICK.

  accel-move-enable:
    type: boolean
    required: false
    description: |
      Enable acceleration scaling for cursor movement.
      If not specified, defaults to CONFIG_PAW32XX_ACCEL_MOVE_ENABLE.

  accel-scroll-enable:
    type: boolean
    required: false
    description: |
      Enable acceleration scaling for scroll movement.
      If not specified, defaults to CONFIG_PAW32XX_ACCEL_SCROLL_ENABLE.

  accel-thresholds:
    type: array
    required: false
    description: |
      List of speed thresholds (counts/ms) for multi-level acceleration scaling.
      Each value defines a threshold for switching to the next acceleration factor.

  accel-factors:
    type: array
    required: false
    description: |
      List of acceleration scaling factors (fixed-point, e.g. 1000=1.0, 1500=1.5).
      Each value corresponds to a threshold in accel-thresholds, plus one for the default (lowest) speed.
